👋 Hi, I’m @LukeVergone

👀 I’m interested in music, videogames, football (mostly AFL & EPL) and sports in general, home renovation projects...

🌱 I’m currently learning python, coding/programming principles.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything i'm able to at this stage. I'm still learning the basics.
